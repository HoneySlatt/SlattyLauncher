# Compatibility

This page records tests made against real GOG services and real games. A result obtained only with
simulated services never appears here.

Achievement support also depends on Comet. See its
[compatibility table](https://github.com/imLinguin/comet/blob/main/docs/wiki/Game-Compatibility.md).

Unless stated otherwise, tests ran on NixOS with niri (Wayland), umu-launcher 1.4.4 and
Proton-CachyOS.
